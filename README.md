# DASM OS is The AI-Powered OS for Autonomous Home Management

**DASM OS** is an experimental, AI-integrated operating system designed for intelligent home management. It combines modular automation, crypto-native economics, and decentralized infrastructure into a unified, open ecosystem.

Built for hackers, systems thinkers, and home-tech enthusiasts.

---

## ⚡ Why DASM?

Most smart home ecosystems are:
- Closed-source and cloud-locked  
- Fragmented across dozens of apps/devices  
- Built for consumers, not creators

**DASM is different** — a programmable, modular OS for home automation, powered by AI and open protocols. Build custom routines, manage resources, or launch decentralized services — all locally or on-chain.

---

## 🔧 Key Features (MVP Phase)

- 🧠 **AI-First UX** — Natural language interface for automating home routines  
- 🧱 **Modular Architecture** — OS components written in Rust/C++ with plugin support  
- 🌐 **Crypto-Native Layer** — Token-based identity, access, and incentives  
- ⚡ **Smart Contract Automations** — Manage energy usage, subscriptions, and roles  
- 📡 **Transparent Ledger** — Decentralized tracking of usage, compute, and participation  
- 🔌 **Local-First Mode** — Offline-capable and privacy-focused by design
